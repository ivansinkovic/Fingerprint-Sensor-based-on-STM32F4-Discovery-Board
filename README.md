# Fingerprint-Sensor-based-on-STM32F4-Discovery-Board
BSc thesis

Software for SPI communication between the sensor and the STM32F4 Discovery Board has been developed. Software for UART communication between the development system and a personal computer has also been developed. System is used to obtain a fingerprint image from a capacitive FingerTIPTM sensor from Infineon Technologies.
